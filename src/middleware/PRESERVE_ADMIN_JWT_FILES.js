/**
 * Admin JWT Token System - What to Keep
 * 
 * This file documents the critical components of the admin token system
 * that should be preserved during any cleanup operation.
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: Do not delete the following files as they are essential
 * for the admin authentication system to function properly:
 * 
 * 1. src/middleware/externalAdminJwt.js
 *    - Provides compatibility with external JWT token formats
 *    - Required for admin API access with external tokens
 * 
 * 2. src/middleware/adminAuth.js 
 *    - Contains core admin authentication logic
 *    - Includes modifications to support external JWT tokens
 * 
 * These files contain critical functionality for the admin authentication system
 * and should not be removed during cleanup operations.
